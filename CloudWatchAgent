In the list of policies while creating IAM Role for EC2 Instance, select the check box next to "CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy". Use the search box to find the policy, if necessary.

Launch an EC2 instance with port 80 and 22 open in the security group.

Part 2 : View the collected cloudwatch custom metrics
In the first part of this lab we configured the cloudwatch Unified agent. Now let's look at the metrics collected by the agent.

Remember: RAM/Memory metrics are not collected by Cloudwatch by default. Cloudwatch agent enables us to collect those metrics not collected by default.

In the config wizard we selected to collect Metrics like Ram etc
